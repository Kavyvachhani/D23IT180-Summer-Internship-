## Summary

During my summer internship, I engaged in various activities and learning sessions focused on cybersecurity. The initial weeks involved induction and setup, followed by practical hands-on experience with Kali Linux tools and virtual machine attacks. I learned about ransomware threats, performed SQL injection and DDOS attacks, and enhanced my understanding of network security fundamentals. The later weeks were dedicated to web application testing, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing using Metasploit. I also explored phishing tools and risk management in data forensics.
