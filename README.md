https://www.vulnlab.com/ , our target is to crack the virtual machine
developed by vulnlab machine name ‘The Earth’ , using kali Linux we
try to access this machine


Day 5: I Learn Training Ransomware Threats

 A virtual training on Ransomware Threats that descripts types of threats
and different type of it and how to protect your organization form That
type of Attacks


Week 2 : 

Day 1 & 2 & 3: I Learn Training, setup Ubuntu server & perform
DDOS and SQL injection Attack
 Second week start with kali Linux attacks performing and we have enrolled an
special training that every employe must have to complete that provide information
about ethics and compony policies and rules and behavior and what things you do
in office or what you don’t this is 48 hours training module that every employ or
intern must completed this so with practicing on different attacks we also
completing one by one this training modules .
Discover some theories on SQL map or how SQL injection are used to
gain data base access and data or directories
 Now try to understand DDOS Attack and its types and discover there
working model , we use a tool open source and available on github
called ‘ Slowloris’

Day 4&5: I Learn Training, Cisco Course on Network
Fundamentals
 At end of second , start learning a fundamental’s of network securities
from Cisco because the networking fundamentals are very important in
this domain

Week 3 : 

This week start with web application testing using Burp Suite
Community application we have given a web application to test and
find vulnerability and exploiter that web tool and make a report on it
 From this week we started advanced web testing with my guider Mr.
Nandakishor sir they assist me and help me into advanced
vulnerabilities testing and we created a detailed report on it the
testing parameters are given below which we make a vulnerabilities
report.
List of vulnerabilities:
 Path Traversal Vulnerability by dot-dot slash attack
 Cross Site Request Forgery
 OS Command Injection
 Unrestricted File Upload
 Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
 Weak Lockout Mechanism
 Login Bypass Using Response Manipulation
 Unauthenticated File Download
 Unauthenticated Access via Cookie Exclusion
 Session Timeout issue
 SSL/TLS TLS-Related Issues
 storing sensitive data in Client-Side Storage
 Self-signed SSL Certificate
 Information Disclosure in the JavaScript File
 Known CVEs
 Weak TLS Ciphers
 Clickjacking Attack
 Weak Password Policy
 Directory Brute Forcing
 Backup File Issue
 Client-Side Desync Attack


week 4 

At next week we started learning ‘Metasploit’ farmwork that can be used to breach
or crack any device or it also used for find VULNERABILITIES
 This week we start an course on Udemy call Metasploit farmwork with below
topics
 In this entire week we discover one course designed by oca academy in Udemy and
learn about Metasploit farmwork from scratch to advanced level . #
 Here is detailed preview of course
Metasploit Framework: Penetration Testing with Metasploit
 Penetration testing skills make you a more marketable IT tech.
 Understanding how to exploit servers, networks, and applications means that you
will also be able to better prevent malicious exploitation. From website and net
 There are many types of penetration testing. Internal penetration testing tests an
enterprise's internal network.
 Penetration tests have five different stages. The first stage defines the goals and
scope of the test and the testing methods that will be used.
 Penetration testing, or pen testing, is the process of attacking an enterprise's
network to find any vulnerabilities that could be present to be patched.
 Ethical hackers and security experts carry out these tests to find any weak spots in
a system’s security before hackers with malicious intent find them and expl
 Become an Expert in Using Metasploit
 Learn Ethical Hacking from scratch with Metasploit
 Importance of Penetration Testing
 Types of Penetration Testing
 Basics of Penetration Testing
 Metasploit Filesystem and Libraries
 The Architecture of MSF
 Auxiliary Modules
 Payload Modules
 Exploit Modules
 Encoder Modules
 Post Modules
 Metasploit Community
 Metasploit Interfaces
 Armitage
 MSF console
 Enumeration
 Nmap Integration and Port Scanning
 SMB and Samba Enumeration


Week 5 

Day 1: Data Forensic, Risk Management Tools study
 New week start with Data Forensic and Learning a new path with data
Forensic how the risk are generated by our mistakes or how to
organization’s are managed that Risk and Tools for IT Support and
introduction’s

Day 2 & 3: penetration testing using Metasploit
 Setting Up Metasploitable:
 Download Metasploitable2 from the official source.
 Install it as a virtual machine (e.g., using VirtualBox or VMware).
 Discovering the IP Address:
 Once Metasploitable is up and running, find its IP address using the ifconfig command
in the terminal.
 Scanning with NMAP:
 Use NMAP (Network Mapper) to scan Metasploitable for vulnerabilities.
 Run the following command to perform a basic scan:
 nmap -A <Metasploitable_IP>
 NMAP will identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
 Exploiting Vulnerabilities:
 Metasploit is a powerful framework for exploiting vulnerabilities.
 Launch the Metasploit console (msfconsole) and search for relevant exploits.
 Example: To exploit an FTP vulnerability, use the appropriate Metasploit module:
 use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
 set RHOSTS <Metasploitable_IP>
 run
 Post-Exploitation:
 Once you gain access (e.g., via a meterpreter shell), explore the compromised system.
 Gather information, escalate privileges, and pivot to other systems if possible.
 Learn and Experiment:
 Metasploitable provides a safe environment to practice penetration testing techniques.
 Explore different vulnerabilities, services, and attack vectors.


Day 4: Phasing Tool - ZPhisher
 Termux ZPhisher is an Advanced Phishing Tool that allows hackers to
perform phishing attacks using termux on their Android phones. This tool
is almost similar to the Hidden Eye Tool as well as it also has some
features of ADV Phishing Tool. This tool has 30 phishing pages including
Facebook, Instagram, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, GitHub,
LinkedIn, Snapchat, Pinterest, Twitch, Spotify, Adobe, WordPress, Yahoo,
crypto coin, Xbox and all the other most-used websites.


Day 5: Phasing Tool - GoPhsing Farmwork
 Gophish is a phishing framework that makes the simulation of real-world
phishing attacks dead-simple. The idea behind gophish is simple – make
industry-grade phishing training available to everyone. “Available” in this
case means two things –
 Affordable – Gophish is open-source software that is completely free for
anyone to use.
 Accessible – Gophish is written in the Go programming language. This has
the benefit that gophish releases are compiled binaries with no
dependencies. In a nutshell, this makes installation as simple as "download
and run"!
